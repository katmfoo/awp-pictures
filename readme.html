<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>My project is broken into two different code bases, a PHP api created with the <a href="https://lumen.laravel.com/">Lumen framework</a> and a static client website created with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.</p>

<p>The api could almost be seen as a totally functioning version of the project, just without an interface. It provides all the real functionality to the client, the client is just making HTTP requests to the api whenever it wants to do something. The api knows absolutely nothing about the client and could be easily reused for a mobile app, for example.</p>

<p>The api uses a token based authentication system. Upon registering or logging in, the user is given a cookie with a unique api token that is sent up with subsequent requests. This token allows the api to identify the user making the request and determine who is uploading a picture or trying to delete a comment (and whether or not they are allowed to).</p>

<h3>What files to look at</h3>

<p>The frameworks I used create a lot of files that you really don't need to look at. I recommend looking over the following files in the following order, the code should document itself well enough. (links go to txt versions of each file)</p>

<h4>Database</h4>
<ol>
    <li><span class="blurb"><a href="db/awp-pictures.sql.txt">db/awp-pictures.sql</a></span>: has all of the sql to create the structure of the database + comments on the structure itself</li>
</ol>

<h4>API</h4>
<ol>
    <li><span class="blurb"><a href="api/bootstrap/app.php.txt">api/bootstrap/app.php</a></span>: bootstraps the api framework, nothing super interesting</li>
    <li><span class="blurb"><a href="api/app/Http/Middleware/Authenticate.php.txt">api/app/Http/Middleware/Authenticate.php</a></span>: middleware to authenticate user requests</li>
</ol>
